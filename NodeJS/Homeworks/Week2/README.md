# cleanest-blog-project

A blog project I've built for my node.js bootcamp classroom. This project is a real-time blog applicaton that you can post, delete, create and update your blogs, see the blogs with pagination and read the blog posts. The project is lack of authorization & authentication. Soon, I will make the project more progressive and up-to date. 

## Technologies I have used to develop this project:
### Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
### Express.js (https://expressjs.com/)
### Ejs (https://ejs.co/)
### Mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/)
